ÅngströmDB
==========

Very simple key-value noSQL database, based on [LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) and [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org/).

Created as code example during a talk. ÅngströmDB was designed for educational usage only.

* No error management.
* Some parts are naively implemented.
* No replication mechanism.

See [FineDB](http://www.finedb.org) for a real high-performance noSQL database.
